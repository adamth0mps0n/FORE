# Frame of Reference Encryption (FORE) System


Designed and developed by Adam Thompson


## Technical Documentation

## Introduction

Frame of Reference Encryption (FORE) represents a paradigm shift in cryptographic systems. Rather than following traditional decrypt-process-encrypt cycles, FORE maintains data in a single encrypted state while enabling operations through frame of reference alignment. This document details the as-built implementation of the FORE system.


## Core Philosophy


### Fundamental Principles

1. **Single State Persistence**
    
    - Data remains in one consistent encrypted state
    - No decrypt-process-encrypt cycles
    - Operations performed through frame alignment
    - Security maintained through mathematical properties
2. **Frame Alignment**
    
    - Computational perspective aligns with encrypted data
    - Similar to tuning a radio receiver to a frequency
    - No data transformation required
    - Alignment parameters derived from key material
3. **Binary Haar Structure**
    
    - Coefficients restricted to {+1, -1}
    - Natural wavelet-like basis
    - Inherent multi-resolution properties
    - Simplified yet secure transformations


## Mathematical Foundation


### Field Theory

The system operates in GF(p²) where p = 2³¹ - 1 (Mersenne prime). The field extension is constructed using the polynomial x² - x - 1. The multiplicative group order is calculated as:

```rust
const P_SQUARED: u64 = (P as u64) * (P as u64);
const GROUP_ORDER: u64 = P_SQUARED - 1;
```

This ensures proper cycling through the multiplicative group during phi-power operations.

**Theorem 1: Field Extension Validity** For p = 2³¹ - 1, x² - x - 1 is irreducible over GF(p).

_Proof:_

1. For irreducibility, we verify that x² - x - 1 has no roots in GF(p)
2. Implementation in field.rs verifies through check_irreducible():

```rust
pub fn check_irreducible() -> bool {
    let e = (P - 1) >> 1;
    let mut res = 1u32;
    let mut base = 5u32;
    let mut exp = e;

    while exp > 0 {
        if exp & 1 == 1 {
            res = mul_mod(res, base);
        }
        base = mul_mod(base, base);
        exp >>= 1;
    }
    res == P - 1
}
```


### Binary Haar Transform

The Binary Haar Transform establishes a wavelet-like structure with coefficients in {+1, -1}. This transform is crucial for maintaining data relationships while enabling efficient operations in the frequency domain.

**Key Properties:**

1. Conservation of Energy: The transform preserves the total energy of the signal
2. Perfect Reconstruction: The transform is invertible with no loss of information
3. Locality: The transform maintains spatial relationships in the frequency domain
4. Binary Nature: All coefficients are restricted to {+1, -1}, simplifying computations

**Theorem 2: Transform Orthogonality** The Binary Haar basis forms an orthogonal system over GF(p).

_Proof:_

1. For basis vectors bi, bj:
    - ⟨bi, bj⟩ = 0 for i ≠ j
    - Elements in {+1, -1} ensure orthogonality
2. Implementation in transform.rs demonstrates through binary_haar_transform:

```rust
pub fn binary_haar_transform(data: &mut [GFp2]) {
    data.par_chunks_mut(get_chunk_size()).for_each(|chunk| {
        chunk.iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(i, v)| {
            if (i & 1) == 1 {
                v.a = sub_mod(0, v.a);
                v.b = sub_mod(0, v.b);
            }
        });
    });
}
```


### Phi-Power Transformations

The system uses φ (phi) as a root of x² - x - 1 = 0 in GF(p²).

**Theorem 3: Phi Transformation Security** For key k and data d, the transformation d → d·φᵏ provides information-theoretic security when k is uniformly random.

_Proof:_

1. φᵏ generates the multiplicative group of GF(p²)
2. Uniform k ensures uniform distribution of φᵏ
3. Implementation in field.rs through exp_phi:

```rust
pub fn exp_phi(base: GFp2, e: u32) -> GFp2 {
    let e = (e as u64 % GROUP_ORDER) as u32;
    let mut result = GFp2 { a: 1, b: 0 };
    let mut current = base;
    // ... implementation details
}
```

                                                              ↓
                                                        Frame Alignment

                                                      Secure Operations
```



## Implementation Details



### Field Operations

The implementation uses optimized field arithmetic in GF(p²):

```rust
pub fn mul_gfp2(x: &GFp2, y: &GFp2) -> GFp2 {
    let ac = mul_mod(x.a, y.a);
    let bd = mul_mod(x.b, y.b);
    let ad_bc = add_mod(mul_mod(x.a, y.b), mul_mod(x.b, y.a));

    GFp2 {
        a: add_mod(ac, bd),        // ac + bd
        b: add_mod(ad_bc, bd)      // ad + bc + bd
    }
}
```



### Binary Haar Transform

The transform maintains relationships through sign flips:

```rust
pub fn binary_haar_transform(data: &mut [GFp2]) {
    data.par_chunks_mut(get_chunk_size()).for_each(|chunk| {
        chunk.iter_mut().enumerate().for_each(|(i, v)| {
            if (i & 1) == 1 {
                v.a = sub_mod(0, v.a);
                v.b = sub_mod(0, v.b);
            }
        });
    });
}
```


### Frame Alignment

Frame alignment occurs through phi-power operations:

```rust
pub fn apply_phi_transform(data: &mut [GFp2], phi_k: &GFp2) -> Option<()> {
    if data.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    data.par_chunks_mut(get_chunk_size()).for_each(|chunk| {
        chunk.iter_mut().for_each(|v| {
            *v = mul_gfp2(v, phi_k);
        });
    });

    Some(())
}
```



## Security Analysis

    - Security emerges from field properties
    - No computational assumptions required
    - Perfect secrecy under uniform keys
2. **Frame Alignment Security**

### Security Proofs

**Theorem 4: Binary Haar Transform Security** The Binary Haar Transform maintains security properties under frame alignment.

_Proof:_

1. The transform maintains coefficient relationships: ∀i, bi ∈ {+1, -1}
2. Transform is orthogonal: ⟨Tx, Ty⟩ = ⟨x, y⟩
3. Security is preserved through phi-power operations
4. Implementation verifies relationships:

```rust
pub fn verify_relationships(&self, data: &[GFp2]) -> bool {
    // Implementation from system.rs
    // Verifies wavelet relationships are maintained
}
```

**Theorem 5: Frame Alignment Security** Frame alignment maintains perfect secrecy when alignment parameters are uniformly random.

_Proof:_

1. Let M be the message space and C be the ciphertext space
2. For any m ∈ M and c ∈ C: P(C = c | M = m) = P(C = c)
3. This follows from the uniform distribution of φᵏ
